# DeepBayesNetwork
Few-shot classification is a typical branch of small sample learning. In this work, we propose a novel deep Bayes network to significantly improve the performance of few-shot classification. At the end of network model, Bayes classifier is used instead of fully connected layers in traditional convolutional neural network. The Bayes classifier can utilize fewer parameters to perform samples classification, it effectively overcomes the problem with insufficient data in few-shot classification. In order to solve the classification error caused by the mixing of unknown classes in practice, we incorporate a Bayesian decision strategy into the network model to identify the known classes and reject the unknown classes. We conduct few-shot classification experiments on the miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and Omniglot datasets, and open-set classification experiments on the miniImageNet and tinyImageNet datasets, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method is state-of-the-art comparing with other models.
